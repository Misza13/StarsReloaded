# Stars! Reloaded
**Stars! Reloaded** is a modern reedition of the legendary 4X game Stars!

## What is Stars! ?
**[Stars!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars!)** is a space-themed, turn-based strategy game ([4X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4X), [PBEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBEM)) originally released in 1995 for Windows 3.1. If features only rudimentary graphics but also extreme replayability and its gameplay is based on deep strategy (starting with complex race design all the way through management of dozens of planets and commanding of hundreds of fleets to scheming with other players) and high level of micromanagement required to succeed. It has gathered a very strong following and community that is still active but has diminished in recent years. 

## Why Stars! Reloaded?
Stars! was originally released on Windows 3.1 and is a 16-bit executable. As technology and OS-es advanced, it became increasingly difficult to run on modern computers. At first, most obstacles could be solved by various compatibility options in subsequent versions of Windows. Windows 7, however, once and for all dropped support of 16-bit mode and all further attempts to run the game are based purely on some form of virtualization. Some of the most successful attempts include using WINE (Linux-based), DOSBox and VirtualBox. This naturally limits the market to only the most tech-savvy and determined fans of the game as well as walls off potential newcomers.

Stars! Reloaded intends to reanimate this great game, recollect those who have given up it as well as introduce it to a whole new generation of players. At the same time, we need to acknowledge the technological advance of the last 20 years and develop the reedition with all the cutting-edge technology that can make many aspects of the original game even more enjoyable (especially those related to multiplayer mode).
